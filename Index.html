        <h2>LET ME INTRODUCE</h2>
        <blockquote>
            “Innovation thrives on the bravery to defy the conventional and the foresight to craft the remarkable”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I'm an aspiring UI/UX designer and currently an undergraduate at IJSE. I am passionate about creating user-centric designs and am skilled in tools like Adobe XD, Sketch, and Figma. My focus is on learning and applying design principles to enhance user experiences through effective research, wireframing, prototyping, and visual design.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm eager to build my expertise and apply my skills in real-world projects. Outside of design, I enjoy traveling and photography, which fuel my creativity and perspective. I also participate in design-related community events and volunteer for local design initiatives.
